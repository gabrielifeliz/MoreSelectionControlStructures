2. Process customer record
A program is required to read a customer’s name, a purchase amount and a tax code. 
The tax code has been validated and will be one of the following:
    0  tax exempt (0%)
    1  state sales tax only (3%)
    2  federal and state sales tax (5%)
    3  special sales tax (7%)
The program must then compute the sales tax and the total amount due,
and print the customer’s name, purchase amount, sales tax and total amount due.

CHECKS
customerName = Amy Ramirez, purchaseAmount = 450, taxCode = 0
output should be Amy Ramirez, $450, $0, $450
salesTax = 0
totalAmountDue = 450

customerName = Steven Johnson, purchaseAmount = 175, taxCode = 2
output should be Steven Johnson, $175, $8.75, $183.75
salesTax = 175 * 0.05 = 8.75
totalAmountDue = 175 + 8.75 = 183.75
