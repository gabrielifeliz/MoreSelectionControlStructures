3. Calculate employee's pay
A program is required by a company to read an employee’s number, 
pay rate and the number of hours worked in a week. 
The program is then to validate the pay rate field 
and the hours worked field and, if valid, compute the employee’s weekly pay 
and then print it and the input data.

Validation: According to the company’s rules, 
the maximum hours an employee can work per week is 60 hours, 
and the maximum hourly rate is $25.00 per hour. 
If the hours worked field or the hourly rate field is out of range,
the input data and an appropriate message are to be printed 
and the employee’s weekly pay is not to be calculated.

Weekly pay calculation: Weekly pay is calculated as hours worked times pay rate. 
If more than 35 hours are worked, payment for the overtime hours worked 
is calculated at time-and-a-half.

ALGORITHM
Receive employeeNumber
Receive payRate
Receive hoursWorkedWeekly


INPUTS
employeeNumber
payRate
hoursWorkedWeekly

PROCESSING STEPS
Receive employeeNumber
Receive payRate
Receive hoursWorkedWeekly
If inputs are valid, calculate weekly pay. Else, display error message 
If 35 hours or less are worked, multiply hoursWorkedWeekly by payRate to get weeklyPay
Else, calculate weeklyPay by calculating 35 hours of regular payRate 
and overtime hours at time-and-a-half.


OUTPUTS
Display employeeNumber, payRate, hoursWorkedWeekly, and weeklyPay


PSEUDOCODE
Initialize weeklyPay to zero
Prompt user for employeeNumber
Get employeeNumber
Prompt user for payRate
Get payRate
Prompt user for hoursWorkedWeekly
Get hoursWorkedWeekly
IF hoursWorkedWeekly <= 60 AND payRate <= 25
	IF hoursWorkedWeekly <= 35 
		Calculate weeklyPay = hoursWorkedWeekly * payRate
		Display employeeNumber, payRate, hoursWorkedWeekly, and weeklyPay
	ELSE
		Calculate weeklyPay = (35 * payRate) + ((hoursWorkedWeekly - 35) * payRate * 1.5)
		Display employeeNumber, payRate, hoursWorkedWeekly, and weeklyPay
	ENDIF
ELSE IF hoursWorkedWeekly > 60
	Display exceeded maximum hours message
ELSE IF payRate > 25
	Display exceeded pay rate message
ENDIF
